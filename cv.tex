%\section{intro}
%I am a software engineer that loves to design, test, implement and deploy complex distributed system. 
%Despite enjoying the design role as an architect, I also am passionate about coding as well as developing the tools and libraries that abstracts and  provide an easy way to use it.
%Currently looking forward to work in a diverse cultural environemnt in order to make the preexisting cloud computing state of art obsolete.
